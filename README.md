# NetLogo AR
## What Is It
NetLogo AR is a spatial Augmented Reality (AR) authoring toolkit that combines room-scale AR technology with NetLogo. It is freely distributed as a part of [Turtle Universe](https://turtlesim.com/products/turtle-universe/), the mobile version of NetLogo. [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) is an agent-based programming language widely used in both scientific research and education. It enables the creation of room-scale multi-agent models, simulations, artworks, or games with existing NetLogo grammar. It also enables the seamless blending of existing NetLogo models into the physical world around you. Figure 1 and 2 demonstrates a sample transition included in this repository.
